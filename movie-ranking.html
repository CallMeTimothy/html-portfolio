<p><h3>Avatar: Way of Water</h3>it was a great movie in terms of visuals and music, the story was fantastic with a great set up for future films.</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>An amazingly animated movie with a story so intriguing its sucks the audience withing the universum of the movie.</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>Elementals</h3>Animated movie made by Disney was suprisingly good, a story of a society of elemental people in which two elements, water and fire that should not mix fall for each other.</p>
<p><h4>I highly recommend watching all of these</h4><h5>Timothy</h5></h2></p>
